# MyBioinformatics_journey

My interest in Bioinformatics started while at my second year of studies at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. This was triggered and driven by my interest in research especially with my passion in drug research and development. I look forward to advancing my skills and knowledge in bioinformatics through a collaborative learning.

## Mission statement

To gain more knowledge in bioinformatics particularly in cheminformatics, immunoinformatics, molecualr docking and drug simulation in order to enhance my research and data analytics skills.

## Vision statement

To promote bioinformatics research and education in Africa to accelerate African research efforts on human and pathogen genomic research and discovery for prevention and treatment of genetic diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

# Career Roadmap

I have an interest in drug research and development and I look ahead to advancing my studies in Bioinformatics to enhance my expertise in Computer Aided Drug Research and Design (CADD) to contribute for bioinformatics capacity development in Africa

# Milestones

## Long term

1. To be an expert in CADD.
2. Establishment of a Bionformatics Research and education hub in Africa.

## Short term

1. Fostering my expertise in molecular docking, drug simulation and modelling to improve my research skills in drug R$D.
2. Learn about big data analysis and filtration tools. 
2. Encouraging and catalyzing individual and institutional research collaboration among students and researchers within Africa.

## The Bioinformatics Career Development and Future Aspirations

The growth and developement of technology has really revolutionized the field of Science and medicicne. Bioinformatics is a fast growing field and it is changing the scope of various operations in SCience. Personally, I have a great passion in drug R&D, and my current reserach interest is antimicrobials R&D. I therefore, would wish to learn and utilize technology (bioinformatics) to enhance my skills in research, particularly in drug research and development. This is because technology-oriented research is quick, efficiet and accurate. This is intriguing to me as far as drugs and vaccines R&D is concern. So, I want to explore and utilize bioinformatics skills to expetize my competency in Computer Aided Drug Research and Design, especially in antimicrobials reserach and development. The rate of discovery and development of antimicrobials has been quite slow since 1980s, despite the growing global health threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I believe that by acquring an in-depth knowledge on bioinformatics, I will develop excellent skills in CADD which will go a long way in providing sustainable solutions to the pressing global health threat of AMR. Besides, I am envisioing to promote Bioinformatics capacity development in Africa.
